# Escape
Escape Minigame inspired by Dead by Daylight

Escape is my first minigame plugin that spins the popular cat and mouse game, Dead by Daylight, into Minecraft! Essentially, a group of players will join a minigame and one player will become the **KILLER** while the rest become **RUNNERS**. The goal of the **Killer** is to kill all **Runners** before they can make their escape. The **Runners** must escape by powering up generators and using their abilties wisely to open the singular exit gate door and running through it without dying!
